 * https://leetcode.com/problems/widest-vertical-area-between-two-points-containing-no-points/
 *
 * Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.
 *
 * A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.
 *
 * Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * ​
 * Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
 * Output: 3
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * n == points.length
 * 2 <= n <= 105
 * points[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= xi, yi <= 109
