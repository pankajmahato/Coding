 *
 * On a social network consisting of m users and some friendships between users, two users can communicate with each other if they know a common language.
 *
 * You are given an integer n, an array languages, and an array friendships where:
 *
 * There are n languages numbered 1 through n,
 * languages[i] is the set of languages the i​​​​​​th​​​​ user knows, and
 * friendships[i] = [u​​​​​​i​​​, v​​​​​​i] denotes a friendship between the users u​​​​​​​​​​​i​​​​​ and vi.
 * You can choose one language and teach it to some users so that all friends can communicate with each other. Return the minimum number of users you need to teach.
 *
 * Note that friendships are not transitive, meaning if x is a friend of y and y is a friend of z, this doesn't guarantee that x is a friend of z.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 2, languages = [[1],[2],[1,2]], friendships = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: You can either teach user 1 the second language or user 2 the first language.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, languages = [[2],[1,3],[1,2],[3]], friendships = [[1,4],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Teach the third language to users 1 and 3, yielding two users to teach.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 2 <= n <= 500
 * languages.length == m
 * 1 <= m <= 500
 * 1 <= languages[i].length <= n
 * 1 <= languages[i][j] <= n
 * 1 <= u​​​​​​i < v​​​​​​i <= languages.length
 * 1 <= friendships.length <= 500
 * All tuples (u​​​​​i, v​​​​​​i) are unique
 * languages[i] contains only unique values
 *
